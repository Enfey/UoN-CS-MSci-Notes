# Ethics by design
> Ethics by design refers to intentional integration of ethical principles into the design and development process of technology, particularly in AI. 

Aims to foster trust, promote user agency, and mitigate risk associated with AI systems, enhancing their societal impact. 

## Core Principles of Ethics by Design
### Human-Centricity
> Emphasises importance of designing technologies that prioritise needs, values, experiences, of userbase, ensuring that human welfare is at the forefront of technological development. Advocate for diverse user perspectives and the potential impact of design decisions on different populations. 
### Transparency
> Involves providing users with clear + accessible information about how technologies function including data usage, algorithms, and decision-making processes, ensuring trust, and users are informed participants interacting with the designated technologies. 
### Accountability
> Establishes framework for identifiying responsibility for design decisions and subsequent outcomes, ensuring that designers + orgs are answerable to users + stakeholders.
### Inclusivity
> Emphasises importance of engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders during design processes, ensuring that various perspectives, particularly marginalised ones, are represented. Enhance social equity in outcomes. 

## EbD approaches - Value Sensitive Design (VSD)
> Methodological framework that systematically accounts for human values in design of technological systems. Friedman et al., VSD emphasises the integration of ethical considerations at every stage of technology lifecycle, ensuring resultant designs align with diverse stakeholder values. 

1. **Conceptual investigations** - Define Values
2. **Empirical investigations** - gather data
3. **Technical investigations** - design solutions
4. **Balancing values** - stakeholder engagement
5. **Iterative process** - refining designs according to stakeholder engagement
### Strengths and Critiques
- **Strengths**
	- Fosters cognizant approach toward ethics in technology d&d, ensuring that values of diverse stakeholders are integrated into the design process. Strengths include 1) promoting ethical awareness in design and compelling designers to consider societal impacts of their work 2) encouraging stakeholder engagement, lead to more holistic solutions. 
- **Critiques**
	- Operationalisation difficulties, translating tehoretical values into actionable design principles and investigatory principles is complex
	- Conflicting values amongst stakeholders forcing compromises that dilute the effectiveness of VSD.

### Use Case - Parental Control Tools
> Exemplify VSD by integrating needs of parents, teens and children. Design process involves empirical research and deployment of technical features that balance safety, privacy, and autonomy, as identified values. 


## EbD Approach: Privacy by Design and by default
> Proactive framework that integrates privacy considerations into technology development process; now a core principle rather than afterthought. Emphasises prevent privacy risks before they materialise and promotes user control over personal data.

### Core Principles
- **Proactive not Reactive**
	- Anticipate privacy issues before they occur, so can create systems from initial design stage that inherently protect user privacy without relying on oversight or user intervention.
- **Privacy as the default setting**
	- Systems must be designed to provide maximum privacy protection from outset, ensuring data collection and sharing are minimsed and that users not exposed to privacy risks via default configurations. 
- **User-centric**
	- Empowers individuals to have control over personal data. Includes providing clear options for consent, access, and data modification. 
### Strengths and Critiques of PbD
- Offers numerous benefits, particularly enhancing user trust and confidence. Embedding privacy measures at the core of design, organisations can significantly reduce risk of data breaches (and therefore material hazards), protecting user info. Proactive approach safeguards users and aligns with legal requirements too, fostering culture of responsibility. 
- Despite advantages, implementation of PbD can be complex and resource-intensive, organisations may encounter challenges in integrating privacy features seamlessly into existing systems, furthermore, pursuit of strong privacy measures might necessitate trade-offs with system functionality.

## EbD Approaches: Participatory design in AI development
> Emphasises active involvement of all stakeholders in design process, particularly users, ensuring developed AI systems align with their needs and values, fostering collaboration, enhanced user acceptance, and mitigates ethical risks in AI development via direct stakeholder engagement.

### Core Principles
- **Collaboration**
	- Emphasises collaboration between designers + users, ensuring final product meets actual needs and desires of end-users.
- **Empowerment**
	- Involves actively giving voice to marginalised groups, ensuring they are integrated into design processes, resulting in inclusive products.
- **Contextual understanding**
	- Crucial in participatory design, requires designers to deeply engage with environments and challenges faced by users, ensuring design solutions are relevant and practical, more effective solutions. 
Critiques include potential for groupthink, overshadowing of marginalised voices, resource-intensive commitment, complexity in decision making. 

## EbD Approaches: Responsible Research and Innovation
> Framework promoting anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness. Encouraging designers to consider societal impacts and stage technical/design choices according to a formulated structure, integrating ethical considerations into the research process and ensuring that innovations are the result of staged ethical processing.

### Anticipation
Proactive approach to foreseeing and mitigating potential risks associated with technological advancements, must anticipate societal impacts + ethical dilemmas before they manifest.
### Inclusion
Involves active participation of various stakeholders, including communities, policymakers, and industry representatives, in research and innovation processes. 
### Reflexivity
Requires researchers to continuously reflect on ethical implications of their work across broad social contexts, fostering accountability. Via responsiveness, can adapt methods + approaches based on ethical considerations. 

Critiques include resistance from traditional paradigms, inconsistency of implementation, conflicting stakeholder interests, short-term focuses overshadowing general ethical practices, and resource constraints hindering the viability of this approach.

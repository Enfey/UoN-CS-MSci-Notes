Concerns, NLP technologies, neg impact society; distort public opinion, spread misinfo, create filter bubbles.

## Bots and Fake News
- Bots, amplify false content, before goes viral
- Post, share, reply, mention influencers, manipulate
- Bots; exploit social bias - manipulate real users, re-share fake content
- Study, 14 mil tweets, spreading 400k articles, 2016
	- Only 6% of accounts, produced 31% of low-credibility info
	- Act, 2-10 secs of fake news appearing

## Targeting influencers
- Research by Stella et al, 4M tweets during Catalonia independence referendum
- Bots, targeted influencers who supported independence with "negative and violent content" - **social hacking**
- Influencers didn't realise, amplified misinfo
- Regulation, laws, incentives needed, to ensure regulation

## Filter Bubbles
- Personalised info ecosystems shaped by:
	- **Likes, views, shares**
	- **Friend's content**
	- **Browsing history, location**
- Create self-reinforcing echo chamber, no open discourse of divergent opinions
- Conspiracy theories+hoaxes easily spread inside filter bubbles
- Viral spread, leads perception, "if everyone saying, must be true"
- Utterly detached from alternative narratives.

### Attention economy
- Internet company business model = ad revenue based - based on "views" and "interaction"
- Currency paid by users = **attention**
	- "Focused mental engagement on particular item of information"
- **Recommendations**, lure viewers, maximise attention, personalised/filtered content based on personal data, e.g., FYP = recommendations
- Psychological impact = catastrophic; likes, shares, notifs = dopamine responses, addictive. Associated rising depression + anxiety, esp in young people (social groups tight knit)
	- Inquest findings, death, Molly Russell, found took life, suffering from depression, interacted with recommended content. 

### Problem with filter bubbles
- Algorithms *may* be well-intentioned; often instantiate alternative realities
- In combination w/ attention economy, lead to disconnected worldviews formed
- Filter bubbles amplify misinformation; spectacular; sensationalist, emotional stories get shared + seen, only within bubbles, k-group disconnect
- Internet-based content means divergent views filtered out, promote division by not facilitating healthy exposure to challenge.



### Filter Bubbles: Case Studies and Research
#### Cambridge Analytica
- Harvested, data, 50M facebook users, false pretenses (personality quiz)
- Targeted political ads, on basis of data, during 2016 US election+brexit
- Whistleblowers, revealed, large-scale manipulation, voter behaviour, political outcomes twisted, via distorted filter bubbles invoked, due to political ads.
- Research linked Filter bubbles, to political outcome
	- Active social media use for politics, related to less support for Trump
	- Passive/uncivil social media, linked to likelihood to support Trump/republican
#### Are we all stuck in bubbles?
- Benchmann & Nielbo(2018):
	- 1000 facebook news feeds, 1000 danish users
	- Only 10-28% danish fb users in distinct filter bubbles
	- Users' own behaviour, major predictor - page likes, group memberships - **self selection**
- Flaxman et al(2016)
	- Studied web browsing history 50k ppl
	- Social networks + search engine associated, increase in mean ideological distance between individuals
	- Counterintuitively, both channels, increase individual's exposure to cross-ideological content, effects are modest, underlying inclination reinforced by recommended. 
#### Covid "Infodemic"
- Misinfo had 500bm views on Fb
- Fake stories = virus is hoax, drinking chemicals make immune
- Research, single piece of misinfo, caused **800 deaths**

### Solutions
1. **Fact Checking**
	- Orgs, verify accuracy, political-related claims; political debates "fact-checked" live by journalists
2. **Education**
	- Propagation, mental tooling, combat fake news, steer toward reputable, non-biased news sources
3. **Tools+technological improvements**
	- Better content moderation, flagging, algorithmic transparency, bot removal, promotes trust.
4. **Regulation**
	- Compel corps do right thing e.g., Online safety act "take preventative measures including design measures, mitigate broad spectrum of factors that enable illegal activity."

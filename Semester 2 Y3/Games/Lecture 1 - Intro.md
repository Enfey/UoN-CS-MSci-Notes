# Framing
 - Part of HCI  theme
	 - Understanding people, the player experience, and examining the results of the design activity
	- Software engineering, technical challenges, and the architecture of games e.g., how should we engineer a game to be responsive
- Interested in drawing comparisons amongst games, e.g., understanding what sort of interactivity occurs in baldur's gate 3, and reflecting on whether it is good, or bad. 
	- Seek to generate new games by experimenting with such features as design elements, by applying frameworks for design knowledge.
## Strong concepts
- Strong concepts in design and HCI are **intermediate-level knowledge** bridging specific instances and general theory to guide design-oriented research. These are generative, focusing on user behaviour over time, rather than static appearance.
- Resides on abstraction level above particular instances, carries a core design idea with its 'attached' instance(s).

## Schell's Elemental Tetrad
- A **game** is a **system** in which **players** engage in **artificial conflict**, defined by **rules**, that result in **quantifiable outcome**
- Four basic elements:
	- Mechanics, aesthetics, story, technology
- Mechanics describe the goal of the game; how players can and cannot try to achieve it, and what happens when they try
	- Supported by technology
	- Aesthetics that emphasise them clearly
	- A story that makes sense of them 
## Mechanics
- Core of what a game is interactively
	- What remains when all the aesthetics, technology, and story is stripped away
- **Types of mechanics**
	- Physics
		- Motion and force
	- Internal economy
		- Elements that are collected, consumed, or traded
	- Progression mechanisms
		- How a player moves through the game world
	- Tactical maneuvering
		- Placement in the world to gain advantage
	- Social interaction
		- Between players

### Mechanics - Space and time
- **Space**
	- **Discrete** - limited number of spaces one can occupy
	- **Continuous** - allowed for unlimited movement within a limited space
	- Have a number of dimensions
		- Mechanically 2D or 3D
	- Having bounded areas that may or may not be connected
- **Time**
	- Continuous or discrete - turn based
	- Clocks - competing something in certain time
	- Races - being faster.

### Mechanics - Objects, Attributes, and State
- Game spaces are filled with **objects**
	- What can be seen or manipulated
- Objects have attributes
	- E.g., pos, colour, speed, maintaining the state of the object, determine what can/cannot do in game
- Some attributes are secret
	- Known by the game, known by all players, known only by one player

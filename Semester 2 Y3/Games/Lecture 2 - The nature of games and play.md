## What is a game?
- May warrant definition, as domain incorporatesa abstract concepts
- We want a vocabulary to term particular recurrent items, questions that we can ask, and use to assess quality, and aspirational goals.
- We want to be able to **compare, descibe, and classify** the differences between games, identifying important concepts, then consider how such concepts operate within or influence a game
	- The application of existing theories is relevant here, including design principles, lenses, strong concepts
- Game design = subjective process, not a solved problem. 
	- Rules, theories, and structures, help us think about design factors and how might affect final output, but do not guarantee a flawless roadmap. 
- A game is something that we ***play***
	- What does it mean to ***play***?

### Play
- Huizinga
	- A free activity standing quite consciously outside ordinary life as being unserious, absorbing the player intensely and utterly...connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gamed by it
- Caillois
	- **Free**: In which playing is not obligatory
	- **Separate**: circumscribed within the limits of space and time, fixed and defined in advance
	- **Uncertain**: course cannot be determined, nor the result attained beforehand, some latitude for innovations left to the player's initiative.
	- **Unproductive**: create neither goods, wealth, nor elements of any kind, barring the exchange of property amongst players, ending in a situation identical to that prevailing at the beginning of the game. 
	- **Governed by rules**
	- **Make-believe**: as against real life, there is a special awareness of an alternate space in which such an activity takes place. 

### Games are a subset of play
- Play examples = a cat with string, LARP, football match
- Only those forms of play that are **formalised** are considered to be games
- Most forms of play are looser and less organised than games. 
- **Game play**
	- Formalised interaction that occurs when players follow rules of a game and experience a system via play
- **Ludic acitivities**
	- Non-game behaviours that we think of as playing e.g., cat with string
- **Being playful**
	- How you inject the proper spirit of playfulness into otherwise ordinary behaviour
	- E.g., spirit of play injected into some other action, telling a joke. 
- **Play is a necessary component of games**
	- Conceptual approach.
	- Play is a component of games; games contain play, and games are fun to play
	- **Play is free movement within a more rigid structure**
	- **Play is whatever is done spontaneously and for its own sake**![](Pasted%20image%2020260127025945.png)



### Schell - Formalising play? 
#### Fun and surpise
- **Lens of surprise: Lens #4**
	- Fun is pleasure with surprises
		- What will surprise players when they play my game?
		- Does the story have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
		- Do the rules give players ways to surprise each other?
		- Do the rules give players ways to surprise themselves?
- **Lens of Fun: Lens #5**
	- Difficulty to analyse, useful to maximise
		- What parts of my game are fun? Why?
		- What parts need to be more fun?
#### Curiosity and Endogenous Value
- **Lens of curiosity: Lens #6**
	- Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity
		- "What happens when I turn this knob?"
		- "Can we beat this team?"
		- "How many times can I jump this rope?"
- **Lens of Endogenous value: Lens #7**
	- A games success hinges of players' willingness to pretend it is important
		- What is valuable to the players in my game?
		- How can Imake it more valuable to them?
		- What is the relationship between value in the game, and player motivations? 
### Rules, play, and Culture
- Games are **closed systems of rules**
	- Rules make up the inner, formal structure of games, prior to players being involved
	- Rules are a defining quality of games, but are not the **experience** of play
- Games are **closed and open systems of play**
	- Play behaviours that are intrinsic to the game itself e.g., firing a rocket with an intrinisic chance to miss
	- But they are also a reflection of the players who play them
- Games are **open cultural systems**
	- They reflect culture and transform culture.

### Definition of game
> *A game is a **system** in which **players** engage in **artificial conflict**, defined by **rules**, that results in **quantifiable outcome**.* - *Salen & Zimmerman*

- **System**
	- Set of constituent parts that coalesce to form a complex whole.
- **Players**
	- One or more participants actively playing the game.
- **Artificial**
	- Maintain a boundary from real life.
- **Conflict**
	- All games embody a contest of powers.
	- Against others, against "the system" etc.
- **Rules**
	- Provide the structure out of which play emerges, delimiting what the player can and cannot intentionally do.
- **Quantifiable outcome**
	- At the conclusion, a player has either won, or lost, or received a numerical score or some other conclusive result
	- Distinguishes games from less formal play-adjacent activities.

### Where to start?
- Lead with **theme**
	- "I want to make a game about the old west!"
- Lead with **mechanics**
	- "I want to make a game with the ability to slide extremely far"
- Lead with **player** avatar/experience/immersion
	- "I want my player to play as someone who suffers from mental illness"
- Lead with **goals**
	- "I want to make a game where the player robs a bank"

#### Resultant design decisions
- **Players**
	- How many players are there?
	- Who or what is the player in the world?
	- Specifies notion of **identity**
- **Goals**
	- What is player trying to achieve?
	- Defined by the game or by the player?
	- Specifies player **focus**
- **Rules**
	- How does the player affect the world?
	- How does the player learn the rules?
	- Specifies **boundaries**
- **Challenges**
	- What obstacles must the player overcome?
	- Is there more than one way to overcome them?
	- Specifies the fundamental **gameplay**
